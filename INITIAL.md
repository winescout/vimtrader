## FEATURE:

I want to explore representing OHLC candlesticks in a neovim environment using unicode characters.

## EXAMPLES:

Neovim doesn't have graphics rendering ability, so we need to look at ascii art for examples of how to do this.

## DOCUMENTATION:

[List out any documentation (web pages, sources for an MCP server like Crawl4AI RAG, etc.) that will need to be referenced during development]

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

[Any other considerations or specific requirements - great place to include gotchas that you see AI coding assistants miss with your projects a lot]
